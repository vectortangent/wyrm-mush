# WOD20 - Experience Points

Experience Points (XP) are gained periodically to reflect what your character has been learning and/or practicing during that time.  You spend them to improve your abilities.  

> Learn how the WOD20 skills system works in the [WOD20 Tutorial](/help/wod20).

`learn <ability>` - Spends XP to learn an ability.
`xp` - Shows your progress towards the next rating level.

> **Tip:** If you ever mess up an XP spend, like by typing the wrong skill name, an admin can help you reset it.
